Hits NOTHING and still goes for this WACK ASS flank
Are you cereal right now bro

IT'S AN EXACT REPLICA! THIS FUCKER EVEN CALCULATED THE DISTANCE OF THE ROPES!
What happened?
Procrastination is all too frequent
AND THE PLANKS! THE NUMBER OF PLANKS IS THE SAME! GO IN THERE AND CHECK FOR YOURSELF! IT'S BUILT 1:1!
Try not to get doxxed challenge (impossible)

The last time was probably like 3 years ago
*random fucking music*
Not like there's enough to populate the list once a week anyway, so it'll just be forgotten in an hour
Trust
Do NOT trust
It's stuck for the rest of the life anyway but it's banned so
What the fuck was that one tweet that Microsoft Edge did
I just hope Studio has some references
I said it before and I'll say it again
Not like it can be played anyway
The funny part is
What is bro doing?
I'm too tired for this shit
It's an honor for me to see them embody what I couldn't accomplish and they don't even know they did it
Mary wanna? Mary wanna what?
Bro I'm NOT doing that shit
Ohhhhhhhh
SHUT THE FUCK UP
My fault
Poptart but replace pop with re
If a tree falls, then it's dead

Posture check
minor spelling mistake
TM fucking I, bro, TM fucking I.
Bro is so ass ðŸ˜­
What the fuck is Shuggy and why do you keep saying it so much
Malignant, you inconsistent shit
I wonder what instruments this song uses
The house is filled with wires outside as it is inside
Keep on dreaming
One day you'll step on clouds
Just not here
Those dance moves SUCK
whar
I can't say that
Mmm yes can't wait to play a video game to destress but instead get more stressed because the only game I play is a competitive one
Come pet a <div>
Your wordplay sucks ass
"SHHHH"
God damn
SS,DD
Bro get off this shit
